De par leur composition les bords et leurs doubles coutures ne se déformeront pas et ne se détérioreront pas dans le temps.  – Modularité : son système de passant breveté lui permet de s’adapter sur différentes tailles de ceintures et/ou ceinturons ainsi que sur d’autres équipements (plaque de cuisse, gilets tactiques, …) Nous avons conçu ce produit afin que 2 types de ports soient possibles : Horizontal et Vertical. Ainsi, le porte-chargeur peut totalement s’adapter à vos besoins et habitudes. De plus, un rabat sécurisant, se fermant par 2 boutons pression, est intégré afin de protéger le chargeur et vous assurer une sécurité optimale. Celui-ci est aussi rigide afin d’éviter toute déformation sous le poids du chargeur contenant des munitions.
